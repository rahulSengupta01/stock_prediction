## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Stocks Prediction Model repository! This project aims to provide a machine learning solution for predicting stock prices using historical data. The predictive model is designed to assist investors and traders in making informed decisions by forecasting potential price movements.

## 2. Setup

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stocks-prediction.git
   cd stocks-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended) and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the necessary datasets and place them in the designated directory (`data/`).

## 3. Usage

Follow these steps to train the model and make predictions:

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your historical stock price data. You can use the provided data in the `data/` directory or replace it with your own.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Process the data and extract relevant features. This might include indicators like moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and more.

3. **Model Training**: Train the prediction model using the prepared data. You can experiment with different algorithms such as LSTM, ARIMA, or any other machine learning model.

4. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data points. Evaluate the model's performance against actual stock prices.

## 4. Model

The project currently includes a basic implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for stock price prediction. You can explore and enhance this model by modifying the architecture, experimenting with hyperparameters, or trying different algorithms altogether.

## 5. Data

The data used for training and testing the model can be found in the `data/` directory. The dataset includes historical stock prices, along with any additional features that might have been engineered. Make sure to maintain the structure and format of the data if you decide to use your own dataset.

## 6. Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of your model, you can use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or calculate accuracy based on price direction predictions. You can implement these metrics in the `evaluation.py` script.

## 7. Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find any issues or have ideas for improvements, please submit an issue or a pull request. Be sure to follow the project's coding style and guidelines.
